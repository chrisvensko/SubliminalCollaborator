SubliminalCollaborator
======================

Sublime Text 2 Plugin for remote pair programming.

This project is still in its infancy, but the intent is to make this into a fully featured and capable 
code collaboration tool with minimal setup and infrastructure to get up and going.

The current feature plans:
- quickly share a file with another user identified via IM system (irc and jabber currently targetted)
- support for HOST and PARTNER roles
- HOST role features
    - show currently viewed region of document to PARTNER
    - show highlighted regions of text to PARTNER
    - send edit/delete events to PARTNER as they occur
    - swap HOST-PARTNER role with other user
- PARTNER role features
    - show highlighted regions of text to HOST ('tell me more about this that you just edited')
    - 'follow' and 'unfollow' toggle (whether you follow the HOST view or not)
    - request HOST to swap roles
